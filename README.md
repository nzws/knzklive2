## Features

### Unlimited live-streaming

- Except for technical limitations, there is never a set limit on live-streaming time.
- The live-streaming server is also hosted by the server administrator, so the server administrator can set the rules.

### Integrate with ActivityPub

- Receive live streaming comments from public posts on ActivityPub. (Not an ActivityPub server, uses Mastodon API)
- You can log in with Mastodon or Misskey server.

### Low latency, watch on any device

- Live-streaming can be broadcasted from the streamer to the viewer with a minimum delay of 1 second, powered by SRS Server. (iOS is not supported to low-latency streaming)
- Encodes video into multiple formats in real-time so it can watch on any device, including iOS, and can watch on the go in low-quality mode.

### Publish live-streaming from any device

- You can broadcast with common broadcast software such as OBS.
- You can also broadcast from the mobile device without broadcast software by using the "Broadcast via browser" feature.
